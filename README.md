# EventTrackerProject

### Overview

My event tracker project is a full stack application that any HVAC company can use to track all aspects of their scheduled maintenances. The app is a good way to track tasks, customer base, and management of employee schedules.

*TODO: Endpoints are working, need to create site navigation.

### REST Endpoints

| HTTP Verb | URI                      | Request Body | Response Body |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| GET       | `/api/hvacpms`          |               | List of HVAC PMs |
| GET       | `/api/hvacpms/{pmId}`   |               | Single PM | 
| POST      | `/api/hvacpms`          | Representation of a new PM| Created PM |
| PUT       | `/api/hvacpms/{pmId}`   | Representation of a new version of a PM | Updated PM|

## Lessons Learned
There were so many lessons learned it's hard to know where to begin. I was able to create an application from scratch that's tied to a database which tracks multiple components of any HVAC company. I first created a full stack app using java for database access. I then went on to update the app to use JavaScript for its database access, and finally created another version of the app altogether using angular for its functionalities.
